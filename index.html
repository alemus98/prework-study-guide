        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.
          <li>Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. Order in JavaScript always matters. 
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>conditional statements such as “if” statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow. Interrupting the control flow in this way allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions</li>
